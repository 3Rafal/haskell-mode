A major mode for editing Haskell (the functional programming language) in Emacs.

Some of its major features are:

 - syntax highlighting (font lock),

 - automatic indentation,

 - on-the-fly documentation,

 - interaction with inferior GHCi/Hugs instance,

 - scans declarations and places them in a menu.

See https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode for more information.
